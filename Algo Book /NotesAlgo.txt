Desirable Properties of Good algo
  1. Correct
  2. Efficient
  3. Esay to Implement

				Question
Problem :-
  Robot Tour Optimization
Input :-
  A set of n points in the plane
Output :-
 What is the shortest cycle tour that visits each point in the Set?


				Answer
NearestNeighbour Heauristic

[  Wrong Approach ]
NearestNeighbour(P)
   Pick and visit an intial point p* from P
     p = p*
     i = 0
   while there are still unvisited points
     i += 1
     Select p* to be the closest unvisited point pi-1
     Visit pi
  Return p* from pn-1

[Wrong Approach]
Closest Pair heuristic

[Travelling SalesMan Problem - TSP]




NOTE -
  ALGORITHMS :- which always produce a correct result 
  HEURISTICS :- which may usually do a good job but without providing any guarantee.
